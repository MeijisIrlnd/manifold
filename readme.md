# manifold: bb's first daw

## about
has this ever happened to you? does opening a normal person daw make you angry? do you wish it crashed more and didn't work very well? do you wish that it was made by one guy smoking infinite rollies? do you wish ableton had a button that made it open command prompts that echo turbo team until you run out of ram?  

today is your lucky day 

from the creators of famous products such as a servo that hits eggs with a knife, <br>
FINALLY <br><br><br>MANIFOLD

manifold is (or will hopefully be once i finish it ha ha) a fully featured DAW, which injects some analog weirdness, and a generous slice of 80s retro futurism into your production workflow

it's very much a work in progress passion project, so if you stumble across this repo don't expect it to actually do anything for a while, it's getting there

## TODO 
- <!p> learn markdown :)
